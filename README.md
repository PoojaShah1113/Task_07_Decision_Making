# Task 07: Ethical Implications of Decision Making

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for Research Task 7, which focuses on the ethical implications of using large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes. The core task was to transform an LLM-generated narrative into a formal, stakeholder-facing report with a rigorous ethical and legal analysis.

The project is based on a hypothetical scenario involving a sports team. An LLM was used to generate a narrative based on a coach's interview, and this narrative was then used as the basis for a strategic decision report.

## Repository Contents

* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* `Task 7`: The final report delivered to the human stakeholders (coach and athletic director).
* `prompts/`: A directory containing the prompt used to generate the LLM narrative.

## Process

The process for this task followed these key steps:

1.  **Stakeholder & Decision Context Definition**: Clearly outlining who the report is for and what's at stake.
2.  **Data Provenance & Scope**: Tracing the origin of the qualitative "data" (the interview transcript).
3.  **LLM Prompt & Transcript Capture**: Documenting the exact prompt and the raw output from the LLM.
4.  **Ethical Analysis**: A deep dive into the ethical and legal implications of using LLM-generated content in a decision-making context.
5.  **Report Generation**: Compiling all findings into a clear, tiered, and action-oriented report.

This project emphasizes the importance of human oversight, transparency, and accountability when leveraging AI tools for critical tasks.
